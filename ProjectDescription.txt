Team Alternate Dispute Method: Rock-Paper-Scissors.
If all else fails, we will have to resort to a deodorant eating contest.
Whoever eats the most deodorant in the shortest amount of time.

Completed Version: The final version of our project will be an ASMR sound application. Users will use the app to listen to
sounds or asmr content. An extended version of the project will be to expand into user requests for voice acting content
if possible. The app will also allow users to network with each other by following specific content creators and commenting
on their work.

The Typical User: Our project is geared towards relaxation. Some users may want to spend an afternoon relaxing on the couch 
or take a nap so they would use our app to find some calming sounds. This could also be used to search for white noise to help
with sleep. Another user could use the app to put on rainforest sounds in the background while they work or read a book.
The app can also be used by people to calm their anxiety or stress if they find a specific sound or arms genre that helps
them, therapeutically.
