      <h2>hello world!</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Senior in Computer Science at UB. I graduate in December 2021 (soon!)
        When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me crying over a K-Drama or watching birb videos.
        As someone who has dealt with disability, I'm very passionate about developing technology
        that is accessible and universal. That's probably why this page is written in semantic html
        (s/o to my screenreader friends!) I use a voice dictation tool called Dragon to code and write!

      <h2>My favorite quote:</h2>
      <p>When life gives you lemons, punch life in the face and take the tree too!</p>
